### How It Was Built

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **UI Framework**: Swing for GUI components.
- **Data Management**: Utilized HashMaps to manage predefined locations and landmarks.
- **Routing Algorithms**:
    - **Greedy Algorithm**: Selects the nearest unvisited location to build the route.
    - **Dynamic Programming**: Uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for calculating shortest paths.

### Classes and Methods

#### `Main`

- **Purpose**: Entry point of the application; initializes and displays the login window.

#### `MapUtils`

- **Purpose**: Provides utility methods for managing locations and landmarks.
- **Key Methods**:
    - `getLocationByName(String name)`: Retrieve location by name.
    - `calculateDistance(Location loc1, Location loc2)`: Compute distance using Haversine formula.
    - `calculateRouteGreedy(Location start, Location end, Location landmark)`: Greedy approach for route calculation.
    - `calculateRouteDynamic(Location start, Location end, Location landmark)`: Dynamic approach using Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

#### `Location`

- **Purpose**: Represents a geographical location with name, latitude, and longitude.

#### `ResultWindow`

- **Purpose**: Displays routing results, including route details and nearby landmarks.
- **Key Method**:
    - `buildResultText(...)`: Generates formatted text for the results.

#### `RouteFinder`

- **Purpose**: GUI for users to select locations, compute routes, and view results.
- **Key Method**:
    - `main(String[] args)`: Launches the application.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- **HashMap**: Used to store locations and landmarks.
- **ArrayList**: Manages lists of locations and landmarks.
- **2D Array**: Used in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for distance matrices.
- **Algorithms**:
    - **Haversine Formula**: Calculates distances between geographic coordinates.
    - **Greedy Approach**: Constructs routes by selecting nearest unvisited locations.
    - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Computes shortest paths between all pairs of locations.
